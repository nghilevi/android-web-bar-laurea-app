- BarLaurea Menu Android App

Finding what food will be servered at Laurea cafeteria has never been easier with this app. The idea is it's not only easy to use for the direct users, it also helps Laurea employees a lot in inputing, modifying and managing entries without any IT knowledge. The app syncs dynamically and offer a good user experience. I created this app by using Wordpress, Java (Android), and a little knowledge of NoBackend solution.
